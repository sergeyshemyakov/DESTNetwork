## Introduction

Decentralized Stash Network, Destnet or DEST Network incentivizes users in a particular area to create stashes of some items, to prepare for a natural disaster (medicine, inflatable boats, radio receivers).

### Why

- South East Asian countries like India, Indonesia and Philippines not only face the highest risks of natural disasters, but also show the highest adoption of blockchain, treating it not merely as a get rich quick scheme.
- Climate change escalates risks of devastating natural disasters, preparing people in zones of risk is a great mitigation strategy. 
- DePIN is a reasonable and exciting use-case for blockchain, but we feel that only a couple of different directions were explored.


## Features

- Destnet a DePIN project, where the idea of a public infrastructure is expanded beyond usual use cases
- Correctness of everything rests on the social consensus: submitted stashes are verified by other users and independent disputors
- Integration with [specific blockchain platform]
- User-friendly UI/UX
